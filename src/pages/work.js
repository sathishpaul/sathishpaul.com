    <p>I am a UI Engineer working at Oracle in the Bay area. I love working with JavaScript, HTML and CSS to bring
      wonderful experiences to life on the Web. I am particularly thrilled with the recent developments to the JavaScript
      language, as well as the incredible layout improvements brought to CSS by Flexbox and Grid.

    <p className="myPrinciplesContainer">
      Here are some of the principles I have come to learn and uphold in my work.
      <ul className="myPrinciples">
        <li>
          To have a ‚Äúleave it better than I found it‚Äù mentality, to be willing to work with and improve code that 
          I did not originally write. 
        </li>      
	      <li>To sweat the details, especially the small ones. They add up to make a big difference in the overall experience. </li>
	      <li>To be pragmatic about when to decide to ship something, as opposed to constantly tinkering with it.</li>
	      <li>The humility to say ‚ÄúI do not know, but I can find out‚Äù and to have a teachable mind.</li>
	      <li>To always remember that people are more important than code. That it is important to treat people right and 
          value them as an individual, independent of their work.</li>
      </ul>
