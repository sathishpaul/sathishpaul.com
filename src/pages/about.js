          <p>
            I am a Christian, husband to my lovely wife, a soon-to-be dad, and a web developer living in the Bay area. 
            My interests include web development, recent advancements in JavaScript and photography.

            I believe Jesus is the answer to any and every human need. The world will be a better place if we all followed what Jesus said: 
              Love the Lord, your God with all your heart and Love your neighbor as yourself.
              It is fascinating that every single commandment can be contained within these two.

            I enjoy making Web applications and I have been thrilled to see the recent developments in JavaScript and CSS.
            Flexbox and CSS Grid have made Web layout so much simpler compared to a decade ago. I am thankful that I have access to these tools and APIs.
